				<h3>Since September 2017 I have been Public Program Manager at <a href="ocean.org"> Ocean Wise Conservation Association</a>.
				</h3>
			<p>
				I manage the adult and community education programs. Click <a href="https://education.ocean.org/communityed"> here </a> for more information
			</p>

				<h3>From 2017 to 2017 I was Executive Coordinator for <a href="http://www.ubclts.com">Let's Talk Science UBC</a>, a science education charity.
				</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Between September 2014 - August 2016, under my leadership, LTS at UBC reached <b> <u>67,000</u></b> young people with the message that science is fun, engaging and relevant. We send volunteers to classrooms and community events across BC and run
						on campus outreach events.</li>
					<li>Each academic year we have around <b> <u>280 active volunteers!</u></b> We provide them with training and opportunities to develop their leadership, teaching and communication skills.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>My role includes:</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Overseeing all the activities and Let’s Talk Science programs and provide advice and support for the volunteers.</li>
					<li>Managing the LTS UBC budget. I inherited the program in deficit, but increased funding from $50,300 in 2013-2014 to over $73,000 for the academic year 2015-2016</li>
					<li>Fundraising from UBC faculties, departments, grants and the Let's Talk Science National office</li>
					<li>Managing and supporting a team of assistant coordinators. Since 2014 the number of assistant coordinators has grown from 5 to 10 due to the expansion of the programs, the majority of whom are faculty of science graduate students.</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>New things during my time</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Expanded the program to Surrey – which was really wanted by Surrey teachers- Surrey has some very improvised areas, but does not get as much attention as the downtown east side. I wanted to change this.</li>
					<li>Obtained the competitive centennial fund worth $6000 to run centennial project Marine Connections- partnership with the aquarium and Sigal Balshine (see <a href=h ttp://www.ubclts.com/centennial>www.ubclts.com/centennial </a> and
						<a href=h ttp://www.projectseahorse.org/blog/2016/10/24/science-is-cool> www.projectseahorse.org/blog/2016/10/24/science-is-cool </a>)</li>
					<li>The Science of Middle Earth summer camp (<a href="http://www.ubclts.com/hobbitsummercamp"> www.ubclts.com/hobbitsummercamp</a>)</li>
					<li>Two high school symposium held on UBC campus 2015 and 2016</li>
					<li>Incorporated into Let’s Talk Science a pre-existing, but struggling outreach program run out of the Beaty Biodiversity Centre, MEED (Modules in Ecology and Evolution) in 2014, which is still going strong</li>
					<li>Formed a partnership between the Beaty Biodiveristy museum and LTS to get Beaty volunteers to classrooms around Vancouver</li>
					<li>The science of the zombie apocalypse, a Halloween event for high school students in partnership with Science World</li>
				</ul>
