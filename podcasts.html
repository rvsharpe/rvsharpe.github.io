			</p>

			<h3>Science and Technology</h3>


			<h4>- <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain" target="_blank">Hidden Brain</a></h4>
			<h5>I love this podcast and am still catching up on all the awesome episodes. Using science and storytelling, Hidden Brain reveals the unconscious patterns that drive human behavior, the biases that shape our choices, and the triggers that direct the course
				of our relationships.
			</h5>

			<h4>- <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain" target="_blank">More or Less: Behind The Stats</a></h4>
			<h5>A BBC podcast. Tim Harford and the More or Less team try to make sense of the statistics which surround us. A must for anyone who wants a little more understanding of all the 'facts' we hear!
			</h5>

			</h5>

			<h4>- <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/science-vs/" target="_blank">Science Vs</a></h4>
			<h5>Super interesting and entertaining, coupled with some top notch science investigation! Science Vs takes on fads, trends, and the opinionated mob to find out what’s fact, what’s not, and what’s somewhere in between.
			</h5>

			<h4>- <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/" target="_blank">Darknet Diaries</a></h4>
			<h5>Perhaps slightly too technical for the general public, but fascinating stories about all things internet!
			</h5>
			
						<h4>- <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w/episodes/downloads" target="_blank">The Infinite Monkey Cage</a></h4>
			<h5>A comedy science podcast from the BBC with Brian Cox and Robin Ince! Makes me laugh and teaches me stuff! Great combination!
			</h5>


			<br>
			<h3>Random Facts! (and fun)</h3>


			<h4>- <a href="https://www.futilitycloset.com/podcast/" target="_blank">Futility Closet</a></h4>
			<h5>The Futility Closet features forgotten stories from the pages of history and ends with a lateral thinking puzzle that is really fun!
			</h5>

			<h4>- <a href="http://qi.com/podcast/" target="_blank">No Such Things As A Fish</a></h4>
			<h5> A weekly podcast in which the QI researchers share their most interesting recent discoveries and laugh at anything and everything.
			</h5>

			<h3>Social Justice</h3>


			<h4>- <a href="https://seriouspod.com//" target="_blank">Serious Inquires Only</a></h4>
			<h5>
				Very interesting and intelligent take on what is happening now!
			</h5>


			<h4>- <a href="http://cheerful.libsyn.com/" target="_blank">Reasons To Be Cheerful</a></h4>
			<h5>
				A very strange thing happened when I started to listen to this podcast....I became a fan of Ed Milliband!!! This is a podcast about ideas, and is sometimes also very funny!. Former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, and host Geoff Lloyd talk to smart thinkers
				from around the world.
			</h5>
			<br>


			<h3>Comedy</h3>


			<h4>- <a href="https://hellofromthemagictavern.com/" target="_blank">Hello From The Magic Tavern</a> </h4>


			<h5>An improvised podcast, set in the fictional world of Foon, hosted by an Earth Human, Arnie Niekamp and his friends, a wizard named Usidore the Blue, and a shapeshifter, Chunt. </h5>


			<h4>- <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02pc9pj/episodes/downloads" target="_blank">Friday Night Comedy Podcast</a> </h4>


			<h5> BBC Radio 4 Comedy Podcast - either The News Quiz or The Now Show </h5>


			<h4>- <a href="http://guiltyfeminist.com/" target="_blank">The Guilty Feminist</a> </h4>


			<h5> Comedian and awesome human being Deborah Frances-White and her guests discuss topics “all 21st century feminists agree on” while confessing their insecurities, hypocrisies and fears that underlie their lofty principles. </h5>

			<h4>- <a href="http://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/" target="_blank">My Dad Wrote A Porno</a> </h4>


			<h5> Imagine if your dad wrote a dirty book. Most people would try to ignore it - but not Jamie Morton. Instead, he decided to read it to the world in this groundbreaking comedy podcast! </h5>

			<h4>- <a href="https://www.harleybreen.com/shittingwiththedooropen" target="_blank">Shitting With The Door Open</a> </h4>


			<h5> An Australian podcast by two parents who happen to be dads. A refreshingly frank podcast by two awesome Dads!</h5>

			<br>

			<h3>Fiction</h3>


			<h4>- <a href="www.thebrightsessions.com/" target="_blank">The Bright Sessions</a></h4>


			<h5>
				The best fiction podcast I have found so far!
			</h5>

			<h4>- <a href="https://www.twoupproductions.com/shows/limetown" target="_blank">Limetown</a></h4>


			<h5>
				This is the first fiction podcast I listened to. It is an amazing one - prepare for a ride! Ten years ago, over three hundred men, women and children disappeared from a small town in Tennessee, never to be heard from again. American Public Radio reporter Lia Haddock
				asks the question once more, "What happened to the people of Limetown?"
